# GTAC Module SDK
Grand Theft Auto Connected Module SDK

# What's this? #
This repository contains the Module SDK needed to build GTAC Modules.

You'll need this if you're compiling a GTAC module.

Usually it's bundled with every GTAC module out for now, but for better maintenance we've set this up.

The need for this repository is continuous updates to the SDKHelper, a helper header which contains helpers to write modules.
